The tutorials are slighty modified versions of the tutorials found in [this repository](https://github.com/heidelberg-hepml/ml-tutorials).
They were made to accompany those [lecture notes](https://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~plehn/pics/modern_ml.pdf), from which the summer school lecture from Tilman Plehn is a part. We recommend to have a look at the repo to see the many tutorials we have and find the ones related to your interests.
